# Udacity-Yearbook-Project
Optional Yearbook Collaboration for Udacity Front-End Scholarship Participants

<p><strong>Question: What is this?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> We aren't 100% sure yet.  What we do know is that we wanted to collaborate on a project together.  If that mean's we end up creating a website with a collage of all the projects that's awesome.  If we end up creating an amalgamation of HTML/CSS/JS and want to show it off, that's great also!</p>  

<p><strong>Question: Can I contribute?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Of course you can!  No matter what your experience/knowledge level is we encourage everyone to contribute.</p>

<p><strong>Question: Where do I begin?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Start off by forking this repo and making changes.  Do whatever it is you want...build upon the boiler plate code, or throw in some JS and link them up to the index...the point is this is about learning, growing, and getting experience as a team :)  Feel free to make edits/contributions to anything!</p>
